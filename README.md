# Telecom-Churn-Case-Study

## Problem Statement

In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal.
To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

In this project, we will analyse customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn.

## Conclusion

* If the average revenue per user is higher, and users who are unhappy with the network are more likely to leave/churn.
* The number of minutes spent on local calls has an effect on churn.
* Churn is also influenced by a large variance in recharge quantity between the 6th (June) and 7th (July) month.
* Users who make more roaming calls in both incoming and outgoing calls are more likely to unsubscribe. The company can concentrate on them too.

**Recommendations**

1. Considering the roam_og_mou_8 variable, customers who have increased their roaming outbound minutes of use are more likely to churn.
2. The network operator(s) must look at their roaming pricing and service quality further.
3. It's possible that their roaming rates are less competitive than their competitors.
4. Increase the service for all facebook, night pack, roaming users in order to save them from churning
5. The company should concentrate on STD and ISD prices. Provide them with STD and ISD bundles packs.
7. It is hoped that the telecom company would collect consumer question & complaints data and tailor their services to their demands.
8. Provide additional internet services on average recharge packs.
9. Customers with increased value-based costs in the action phase are also more likely to churn than other customers. As a result, these clients could be a potential target for an offer.
10. For the month of August, customers with declining STD incoming minutes of usage for operators T to fixed lines of T are more likely to unsubscribe.
11. In the action phase, target clients who have used less minutes of incoming local and outbound ISD calls (mostly in the month of August).
12. Customers with lower outgoing and incoming charges in July and August should be targeted.
13. In August, customers with declining incoming minutes of usage for operators T to fixed lines of T are more likely to churn. Focus is needed here.
